üå§Ô∏è Weather Dashboard in React.js: Overview
A Weather Dashboard built using React.js is a dynamic and interactive web application that allows users to view real-time weather information for selected locations. This tool provides current weather details, future forecasts, and atmospheric conditions in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.
Built with React.js, the dashboard benefits from component-based architecture, which promotes modularity, reusability, and efficient updates. It typically consumes weather data from public APIs like OpenWeatherMap or Weatherstack through HTTP requests, enabling automatic updates based on user input or location.

üß© Key Features and Highlights
- Live Weather Updates
Users can search for any city or allow geolocation-based detection. The app fetches live temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure using API integration.
- Hourly & Weekly Forecast
Interactive graphs or cards display hourly and 5‚Äì7 day forecasts with descriptive icons (e.g., sun, cloud, rain) and numerical values for temperature variations.
- Responsive Design
The dashboard adapts seamlessly across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) using responsive CSS techniques, often leveraging Flexbox or Grid layouts.
- Component Structure
Major components include SearchBar, WeatherCard, ForecastChart, and LocationSelector, allowing clean separation of logic and UI elements.
